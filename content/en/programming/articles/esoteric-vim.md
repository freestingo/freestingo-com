This is a compendium of useful, lesser-known Vim idioms I have stumbled upon and have actually used
in real life, saving me dozens (if not hundreds) of hours of work. The article is meant both as a
resource for the curious vimmer wanting to expand their skill set, and as an answer to the question
puzzled non-vimmers ask themselves whenever they accidentally open Vim and cannot figure out how to
close it: why in the world do people even bother learning this weird text editor in the first place?

### 1. Adding explicit number values to existing enum classes

In one task, I had to add explicit values to a `TranslationCodeId` C# enum we were using. This was
needed because keeping them implicit could (and actually did) allow programmers to silently add new
values in the middle, effectively making all subsequent ones shift downward and possibly creating
discrepancies if any of them were also being persisted in their numeric form somewhere else like a
database.

Basically I had to turn this:

```csharp {lineNos=inline tabWidth=4 style=github-dark anchorlinenos=true lineanchors=enum-pre}
public enum TranslationCodeId
{
   // buttons
   Button_Accept,
   Button_Cancel,

   // labels
   Label_Actions,
   Label_Column,

   // messages
   Message_Confirm,
   Message_GoBack,

   // ...continues...
}
```

into this:

```csharp {lineNos=inline tabWidth=4 style=github-dark anchorlinenos=true lineanchors=enum-post}
public enum TranslationCodeId
{
    // buttons
    Button_Accept = 0,
    Button_Cancel = 1,

    // labels
    Label_Actions = 2,
    Label_Column = 3,

    // messages
    Message_Confirm = 4,
    Message_GoBack = 5,

    // ...continues...
}
```

It is after all a conceptually very easy edit, but it can easily become a nightmare if your enum
does not contain six values only, but, say, 800. Doing it manually would simply be unthinkable, or
at the very least a painfully boring, incredibly time-consuming task. In Vim, you can do it all in
five easy steps in something like twenty seconds:

1. Use a [visual block](https://vimhelp.org/visual.txt.html#visual-block "'visual-block' on vimhelp.org")
   to place a {{< highlight csharp "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}0 {{< / highlight >}} at
   the beginning of every enum field line:

   `<C-v>/}kI0 <Esc>`

   {{< details summary="Explanation" >}}
   - _prerequisites_: place your cursor on the first character of [your first enum field]({{< ref
     "#enum-pre-4" >}})
   - `<C-v>` starts the visual block selection
   - `/}k` jumps to the [closing bracket]({{< ref "#enum-pre-16" >}}) while still selecting and
     navigates one line up, in order to rest the cursor on what is the [last enum field line]({{<
     ref "#enum-pre-15" >}})
   - `I0 <Esc>` inserts a {{< highlight csharp "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}0 {{< /
     highlight >}} followed by a whitespace character before every selected line
   {{< /details >}}

2. The previous action unfortunately also adds the {{< highlight csharp
   "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}0 {{< / highlight >}} before all the commented out lines.
   You can easily remove those with the
   [substitute](https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#%3Asubstitute "Command documentation on vimhelp.org")
   command:

   `:%s/0 \/\//\/\/`

   {{< details summary="Explanation" >}}
   - `:%s/old/new` for example substitutes the word `old` with the word `new` once for every line in
     your currently open file. We want to substitute {{< highlight csharp
     "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}0 //{{< / highlight >}} with just {{< highlight csharp
     "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}//{{< / highlight >}}, but in our command we have to
     escape forward-slashes with back-slashes since the substitute command supports regex syntax
   {{< /details >}}

3. You should now have a {{< highlight csharp "hl_inline=true,style=github-dark" >}}0 {{< /
   highlight >}} sitting just behind every field in the enum definition. You can match the numbers
   you added to the actual enum values by just
   [sequentially incrementing](https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#CTRL-A "Command documentation on vimhelp.org")
   them:

   `vi}ojjg<C-a>`

   {{< details summary="Explanation" >}}
   - `vi}` selects all text inside curly brackets
   - `ojj` switches the cursor position from the end to the start of your current selection, and
     navigates two lines down in order to exclude the first enum field from the visual block
   - `g<C-a>` sequentially increments the first instance of a number in every currently highlighted line
   {{< /details >}}

4. All you have to do now is to make your code compile: record a
   [macro](https://vimhelp.org/repeat.txt.html#q "'q recording' on vimhelp.org")
   for fixing line syntax. A command sequence you could use for this purpose could be:

   `qfdf $i = <Esc>px/,<Enter>^q`

   {{< details summary="Explanation" >}}
   - _prerequisites_: place your cursor back on the [start of the first field line]({{< ref
     "#enum-pre-4" >}})
   - `qf` starts the macro recording on the `f` key
   - `df` deletes all text up until (also including) the first whitespace character in the line
   - `$` puts the cursor at the end of the line
   - `i = <Esc>` inserts the `=` right before the comma
   - `px` pastes back the number you previously deleted with `df` into its right place and deletes
     the redundant whitespace
   - `/,<Enter>^` navigates to the next comma and puts the cursor at the start of the line, so that
     your macro will then be easily sequenceable
   - `q` ends the macro recording
   {{< /details >}}

5. Run the macro however many times you need in order to fix all remaining enum fields. For example,
   if your enum has 800 fields, you can just do:

   `799@f`

   {{< details summary="Explanation" >}}
   - `799` executes the following command 799 times. Why 799? Because you have 800 enum fields, but
     you already fixed the first one in step 4.
   - `@f` executes the macro you previously saved on the `f` key
   {{< /details >}}

Your enum class should now correctly show all of its explicit values [like this]({{< ref
"#enum-post-1" >}}). By composing pretty simple commands (visual blocks, regex substitution,
sequential increments and custom macros) you are able to immediately complete what would otherwise
have been a pretty tedious afternoon.
