The internet sometimes presents me with stuff seemingly written by aliens that have just landed on Earth and have just listened to their first human record.

Take [themilkeyedmender](https://rateyourmusic.com/~themilkeyedmender)'s review of [Julia Holter - Something in the Room She Moves](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/julia-holter/something-in-the-room-she-moves/), for example:

> The way this album is recorded and mixed is striking. [...] the organisation of the sounds is counterintuitive and unreal. [...] Reverbs are prominent and incoherent, some vocal harmonies drenched in cavernous cathedral echoes, but some lead vocals and instruments slapping back in claustrophobic small rooms. We hear this disorienting mixing effect in Sun Girl — listen to the track; what space are we actually supposed to be in right now? [...] It sounds very much like a track constructed in zero gravity, artificial but not computer programmed.

He's basically saying that the use of different quality of reverbs on different instruments leads to a "striking", "counterintuitive", "unreal" result, because they all seem to come from different "artificial" spaces. What he seems not to notice is — this is literally what reverb is meant for. Creating "artificial" and possibly different spaces for each and every instrument in the mix is and has been the norm for every studio album that's been produced in the last 50-60 years or so. He's just making it sound like it's this left-field, esoteric stylistic choice of an effect that some artists choose to apply, while in reality it's basically one of the bare minimum skills producers draw from while producing any kind of genre.

But don't just believe me — go listen to your favorite pop artist. Chances are you'll easily find dry vocal runs juxtaposed to highly shimmered pads, or long-tailed reverbs coating fast violin/piano stabs. This is exactly because it's completely normal, and actually an expected feature of what is generally considered a "normal sounding mix".

In fact, you could even argue that the very opposite of themilkeyedmender's point is true: "experimental", "left-field", "challenging" mixes are usually the ones in which all instruments share the same virtual space (i.e. a techno track in which the bassdrum is as hazy as the drone beneath it, or a punk track in which guitars are as dry as the voice screaming over them). All in all though, mentioning reverb in order to support the fact that the music is "disorienting" is exactly the same as saying that a track is crazy because, say, one instrument is panned hard-left and another instrument is panned hard-right. It's just objective, technical data. They will actually mean something only after you take into consideration the context in which these aspects operate, but they don't mean anything by themselves.

I've sadly noticed by now that, usually, an album's production is only ever mentioned in reviews wrote by reviewers who don't have anything actually interesting to talk about, and only have a very surface level (i.e., just watched a three-minute youtube essay about studio recordings) understanding of production in the first place. This has been no exception.
