**Hyperdrama** is quite simply just the next depressing step in Justice's artistic regression.
At best, these thirteen lifeless tracks sound exactly like demos of the countless
[electro](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/sample-magic/midnight-electro/samples "Sample Magic - 'Midnight Electro' sample pack")/[vapor](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/sample-magic/retro-future-2/samples "Sample Magic - 'Retro Future 2' sample pack")/[retro](https://splice.com/sounds/packs/sample-magic/neon-pop-2/samples "Sample Magic - 'Neon Pop 2' sample pack")
sample packs that are literally flooding the music making market right now.
At worst, they are indistinguishable from the results of what someone would do after googling
"how to make a synthwave song" exactly once and noodling with their plugins for ten minutes
or so, before calling it quits.

Justice could have just stopped after **â€ ** and be remembered forever as incredible producers
nobody could have guessed what other great music they could have made if they only
continued releasing stuff. They instead chose to dispel the myth completely by releasing
three more albums, each one worse than the last.
