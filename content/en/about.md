## ðŸŽ¹ Music

My first, strongest inspiration was the music coming from the [Abbott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NY4pKdA1SnE)
and [Van Halen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsehEPyyXVQ) brothers. I had been playing guitar and drums for years,
when all of a sudden the algorithm thunderstrucks me on my road to Damascus by showing me a video of some guy
[reverse-engineering a Prodigy song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU5Dn-WaElI). After a week I had already
become a bulimic [tutorial-head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWvaxzI1vG4&pp=ygUYbXIgYmlsbCBhYmxldG9uIHR1dG9yaWFs)
and sworn Ableton fanboy.
There's some rumors going around of a Twitch stream of mine during which, in front of a grand total of two viewers
(my girlfriend and some _caccapippo_ guy), I produced the most obscure 2020 summer [hit-song](https://soundcloud.com/freestingo/noclassnomanners) that never was. I will neither confirm nor deny any involvement with it.

## ðŸ‘· Work

My first ever paid work was an internship at [Roland DG](https://www.rolanddg.eu/it).
My onboarding process was actually the result of a two-way misunderstanding â€” I thought they produced musical
instruments, while they thought I was a good social-media manager because one of my
[Fantozzi-related memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFSpNYvDGAg) got a lot of views.
Today I develop software stuff for [oncode](https://oncode.it/people/) (I'm the one with the [anti-U-Boat-camouflaged](https://www.theshipyardblog.com/razzle-dazzle-when-british-artists-fought-german-u-boats/) sweater).
