This website currently satisfies two of my biggest needs:

- having a centralized place in which to store all my notes about any subject;
- finding useful websites without any bloat, ads or spyware.

The first point is the reason why I started working on freestingo.com, while the second point is the
reason it looks like this. I wanted to create an easily readable, browsable and accessible website
both for fast and slow devices, so this stripped-down layout quickly became the most logical
solution. **freestingo.com does not use cookies, does not spy on your online private activities and
never will** because it does not contain any javascript code; all pages in here are static and just
made of [simple HTML and CSS](https://github.com/freestingo/freestingo-com "'freestingo-com' on
GitHub"). I am not unlike the vast majority of netizens in hating popup windows and auto-playing
videos, but I feel like the pushback on the ever-present full-screen pictures and huge title texts
is still not big enough. Marketers have successfully convinced (western) contemporary web designers
that the more empty space there is, the better the user experience will be. In my experience, I've
always found the opposite to be true. Very low information density can look "minimal" or "trendy",
but it also adds unnecessary friction to the usability of the website. Do I really have to scroll
two screenfuls down before I can start reading an article? Do I really have to download a 1MB script
for animating 3D abstract colorful blobs floating around in the background? In my opinion, forcing
people to wait for all these graphics to load before entering your site is a WAY worse user
experience than just having them look at Times New Roman :-)

### Appendix: what is a "freestingo"?

The _fristingo_ is a [traditional sweet dish](https://www.atuttagola.com/firstingo-o-bostrengo-dolce-tipico-marchigiano/ "a fristingo recipe")
made from figs, nuts and grape must. Families usually bake it and serve it to their
children's delight during Christmas time in the Marche region of Italy. It's very tasty and yet
relatively not that well known anywhere else — a great, fool-proof recipe for whenever I need to
impress someone or just need a unique moniker nobody else has ever used before.
