## The name

The _fristingo_ is a [traditional sweet dish](https://www.atuttagola.com/firstingo-o-bostrengo-dolce-tipico-marchigiano/ "a fristingo recipe")
made from figs, nuts and grape must. Families usually bake it and serve it to their children's delight during
Christmas time in the Marche region of Italy. It's very tasty and yet relatively not that well known
anywhere else — a great, fool-proof recipe for whenever I need to impress someone or just a unique
moniker nobody else has ever used before.

## The philosophy

The philosophy behind this website is very simple, a natural product of the synthesis between
two of my biggest necessities (only apparently not related to each other):

- having a centralized place in which to store all my notes about anything;
- finding useful, handy and no-fluff websites without any ads or spyware.

The first point was the catalyst. Usually as your interests and hobbies grow and develop,
the total number of social media you're registered to starts skyrocketing as well: book reviews
on Goodreads, album ratings on rateyourmusic, top 10 movie charts on Letterboxd and "Watch Later"
playlists on YouTube... all these platforms compel you to create and share (after all they exclusively
rely on [user generated, freely submitted content](https://www.scaruffi.com/phi/syn66.html "'The Gift Economy' on scaruffi.com")), but most of us only actually use them as archives,
as _ad-hoc_ digital diaries in which we log and classify anything we have ever liked, disliked, and how much so.
Their main problem, though, always lies in the way each platform chooses the way to catalog and organize
content: they're all similar but never the same, and most importantly they're never how we would want
them to be. As an introvert, the inconveniences of social fatigue are already plenty — adding _multi-social_
fatigue on top of that would be a no-go.

Annoyed by the ever-growing dispersion and inconvenience of my social media net, the choice of
developing my own website basically presented itself very naturally. I also chose to couple it
with the most intuitive yet accessible design I could possibly create. I am not unlike the vast majority
of netizens in hating popup windows, auto-playing videos, full-screen pictures and window-sized layouts
that require an intense scroll-wheel workout before you can ever hope to reach the beginning of the article
you're trying to read. Ironically, you'll have better luck finding an actual unicorn than
[an active website containing none of these annoyances](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ "Motherfucking Website").
Since I'm basically the number one user of this website, I consciously
organize all of its content in such a way it's easily indexable, browsable, readable and enjoyable.
You can navigate the whole site without ever leaving your keyboard because links, buttons and menus
are not just fancy `div`s — they're actual links, buttons and menus.
I've never visited a website about recipes to enjoy its cutting-edge graphics, or to read about how the
authors of the article first stumbled upon this delicious dish in their transoceanic trip during which
they explored exotic places but they were really exploring themselves. I usually visit websites about
recipes to... read recipes! It sounds trivial (it is) and yet it becomes impossible when the loading
page immediately attacks you with a full-screen video (that will never load) and two popups overlaid
one on top of the other asking you permission respectively for sending you spam emails and for accesssing
all of your personal data.

I can't stress enough how important this last topic is to me. Having no devices that gather, process
and send your intimate and personal data out to third parties for profit without our explicit consent
is, nowadays, virtually impossible. Trying to develop some kind of digital service that
actually only does what it says on the tin, with no hidden algorithms silently gathering sensitive
data, would be considered sheer madness — or at the very least, a bad business plan — by literally
every company in the market right now. This is why websites have access to your entire browsing history,
smartphones are continuously documenting (amongst many other things) the exact position, speed and height of your
every step, operating systems are logging your every keystroke, refrigerators now come with the ever present companion app
that must be installed on your smartphone and must have access to your contacts, smart watches have sensors
capable of monitoring your biometric data, bluetooth speakers' microphones are always on,
robot vacuums carefully scan every square centimeter of your apartment and must be connected to the wifi
router at all times... these are just a few of the million examples I can think of right now.
Very few people actively choose not to buy any of these devices. Shortly there won't even be a choice
anymore — markets are rushing to discover new ways to smartify everything and plunder our own personal space.
How many times have we stumbled upon an incredibly spot-on ad banner and thought to ourselves "wait, is my smartphone recording everything I say now?"
Sometimes [that's exactly what's happening](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/11/amazon-staff-listen-to-customers-alexa-recordings-report-says "'Amazon staff listen to customers' Alexa recordings, report says', The Guardian"),
but the sad, disheartening truth is that smartphones do not need to eavesdrop at all in order to generate
higly-specific user profiles — they're already relying on mountains over mountains of data we give them
for free every single day. Therefore, I have no intention of contributing to this constant aggregation with
even a single bit more of your data and my data: **freestingo.com does not use cookies, does not spy on your
online private activities and never will** because it does not contain any javascript code; all pages in here
are static and just made of simple html and css. All the code that makes up this website is freely browsable on my
public [GitHub page](https://github.com/freestingo/freestingo-com "'freestingo-com' on GitHub"), and in
case you really miss filling in cookie consent forms you can always check
[this](https://cookieconsentspeed.run/ "Cookie consent speed run") out — you'll have a blast.
