## Appendix: what is a "freestingo"? {style="font-size:larger"}

The _fristingo_ is a [traditional sweet dish](https://www.atuttagola.com/firstingo-o-bostrengo-dolce-tipico-marchigiano/ "a fristingo recipe")
made from figs, nuts and grape must. Families usually bake it and serve it to their
children's delight during Christmas time in the Marche region of Italy. It's very tasty and yet
relatively not that well known anywhere else — a great, fool-proof recipe for whenever I need to
impress someone or just need a unique moniker nobody else has ever used before.
